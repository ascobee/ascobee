# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Versatile, naturally curious engineer with three years of professional experience. Optimized data entry efforts to reduce inefficiencies and streamline product delivery. Utilizing my chemical and electrical engineering background provides perspective as I develop solutions in Python and C++.

## Highlighted Projects

### [Backend REST API](https://github.com/ascobee/recipe-app-api)

Using Python, Docker and PostgreSQL, I was able to create a backend REST API for a fictional cooking recipe website. After signing in, users can manage their accounts, recipes, images, and more!

### [Cryptobot](https://github.com/ascobee/cryptobot)

Crypto trading bot with market predictions using machine learning.

### [Password Checker](https://github.com/ascobee/password-checker)

Working in Python, I was able to create a password checker that has become a useful tool for myself and could be to others when trying to avoid being a target in a data breach. This uses the Pwned Passwords API to find out how many times a particular password has been leaked. This simple script could be useful for any user.

### [Classic Game: Snake](https://github.com/ascobee/snake-game-cli)

Play the classic phone game "Snake" right in the terminal. The snake never stops moving and grows as it eats apples. Quickly navigate to avoid walls and eating your own tail!

## Currently Working On

- Exploring Amazon Web Services and cloud computing
- Experimenting with the Robot Framework in Python to further develop robotics process automation and test automation skills
