# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Versatile, naturally curious engineer with six years of professional experience. Software and DevOps Engineer for enterprise SaaS products and integrated services for worldwide customers. Utilizing my software, electrical, and chemical engineering background provides perspective as I develop backend solutions.

## Highlighted Projects

### [Backend REST API](https://github.com/ascobee/recipe-app-api)

Using Python, Docker and PostgreSQL, I was able to create a backend REST API for a fictional cooking recipe website. After signing in, users can manage their accounts, recipes, images, and more!

### [Crypto Trading Bot](https://github.com/ascobee/cryptobot)

Cryptobot is a Python project that I'm currently obsessed with. This user-friendly interface allows you to research, monitor, and trade cryptocurrencies through your Robinhood account. I'm adding new features and functionality from a growing list of ideas weekly. Some of the existing features include: execute new market/limit orders, view or cancel existing orders, and produce graphs of historical data. I'm currently working on the next prominent feature: market predictions using machine learning.

### [Password Checker](https://github.com/ascobee/password-checker)

Working in Python, I was able to create a password checker that has become a useful tool for myself and could be to others when trying to avoid being a target in a data breach. This uses the Pwned Passwords API to find out how many times a particular password has been leaked. This simple script could be useful for any user.

### [Classic Game: Snake](https://github.com/ascobee/snake-game-cli)

Play the classic phone game "Snake" right in the terminal. The snake never stops moving and grows as it eats apples. Quickly navigate to avoid walls and eating your own tail!
